# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `pi-skillful`.

## Development setup

```bash
bun install
bun run check
```

The package is source-distributed: Pi loads the TypeScript extension files directly. There is no build step for runtime use.

## Local testing

Install this checkout into a temporary Pi project:

```bash
mkdir -p <test-project>
cd <test-project>
pi install -l /path/to/pi-skillful
pi
```

Then run `/skillful` inside Pi.

For a one-off run without changing settings:

```bash
pi -e /path/to/pi-skillful/extensions/pi-skillful
```

## Pull request checklist

Before opening a pull request:

- Run `bun run check`.
- Run `bun run pack:dry-run` and confirm the package contents are intentional.
- Update `README.md` if user-facing behavior changes.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for notable changes.
- Keep examples and paths generic; do not commit machine-specific paths or credentials.

## Coding guidelines

- Keep extensions small and focused.
- Prefer Pi's documented extension APIs and TUI primitives over private internals.
- Preserve explicit skill invocation even when a skill is hidden from model auto-discovery.
- Be careful when writing project settings. If `.pi/settings.json` would become empty after removing `skillful`, delete it instead.
