## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-09

### Changed

- Switched local development, CI, and publishing workflows from Bun to npm for consistency with Pi package conventions.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- Flattened extension entry point from `extensions/pi-skillful/index.ts` to `extensions/index.ts` so Pi displays the extension as `pi-skillful` instead of `pi-skillful:pi-skillful` in the startup banner.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
